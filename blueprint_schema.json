COMMON PATTERN - East Street Insurance: If you see an East Street Insurance email with a PO Box at the bottom, it is likely: 'P.O. Box 6496, Indianapolis, IN 46206-6496'.

      "fieldName": "LOB",
      "fieldType": "STRING",
      "fieldDescription": "Extract the form number and identify the series number to map to the category. CRITICAL: ONLY extract if you can see an EXPLICIT form ID number on the document. The form ID is typically in format like '031-077', '006-578', '03-15-02', '3-150', '221-XXX'. DO NOT guess or infer the LOB based on document content or context. If you CANNOT find a visible form ID number, leave this field BLANK. WHERE TO LOOK FOR FORM IDs: PRIORITY LOCATION: Check the BOTTOM LEFT CORNER of every page carefully - form IDs are frequently located here. EMAIL SCREENSHOTS: If the image appears to be a screenshot of an email, the form ID typically appears at the TOP CENTER of the page - scan this area thoroughly. Check the TOP CORNERS of every page (especially first and last pages). Look in the BOTTOM CORNERS and FOOTER areas (left, center, and right). Check near or around company logos. Look for small text that looks like a reference number. The form ID may be in various fonts/sizes - scan carefully. Form IDs can start with ANY series number including 221 (e.g., '221-054', '221-XXX'). Common labels near form IDs: 'Form', 'Form No.', 'Form #', or just the number alone. The form ID might appear multiple times on different pages. EXTRACTION STEPS: 1) CAREFULLY scan ALL pages for form ID numbers in format: XXX-XXX or XX-XX-XX or X-XXX. 2) Find the explicit form ID number on the form (e.g., '031-077' or '03-15-02' or '3-150'). 3) Take ONLY the digits BEFORE the FIRST hyphen (e.g., '031' from '031-077', '03' from '03-15-02', '3' from '3-150'). 4) Convert to a 3-digit series number with leading zeros if needed: '031' stays '031', '03' becomes '003', '3' becomes '003', '31' becomes '031'. 5) Use the mapping to return the FULL category description. CRITICAL PARSING RULES: '03-15-02' → series '003' (NOT '031' - take digits before FIRST hyphen only). '3-150' → series '003' (NOT '315' - take digits before FIRST hyphen only). '031-077' → series '031' (three digits before first hyphen). '6-578' → series '006' (pad single digit with zeros). '21-045' → series '021' (two digits padded to three). COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID: Do NOT take all digits before a dash (only before the FIRST dash). Do NOT concatenate numbers across hyphens. Do NOT extract page numbers or dates as form IDs. Do NOT extract policy numbers or claim numbers as form IDs.
